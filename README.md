# Assertion-in-traficLight-stimulation

Say youâ€™re building a traffic light simulation program. The data structure representing the stoplights at an intersection is a dictionary with keys 'ns'
and 'ew', for the stoplights facing north-south and east-west, respectively. The values at these keys will be one of the strings 'green', 'yellow', or
'red'.
